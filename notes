module 1 - the basics

network 
  two or more devices connected together to allow them to share resources and communicate

Node
  any network device that can transmit, redistribute, or receive data

protocol
  set of rules that dictate how nodes communicate on a network

Network Scopes
  PAN - personal area network - smallest distance
  LAN - local area network - "in the building"
  CAN - campus area network - multiple buildings
  MAN - metropolitan area network - city
  WAN - wide area network - 
  WWAN - wireless wide area network
  GAN - global area network

Topology
How a network is laid out - physical and logical

Repeater
  layer 1 hardware device that amplidies and or regenerates an attenuated signal so it travels further down the media.
  commonly inserted inline of traffic

Bridge
  like a repeater but works at layer 2
  it learns and remembers MAC addresses attached on either side of it and uses that knowledge to make intelligent forwarding decisions
  breaks you network up into multiple smaller collision domains
  few poers
  makes software decisions

logical topoligies
  vlans
  subnets
  routing
  subinterfaces
  SSIDs

Bus
  physical - every system connected to the same line (thicknet/thinnet)
  logical - when on person is talking, everyone else can hear what's being said
  still used in most modern automobiles (CAN-BUS)

Ethernet protocol
  used in wired networks

Collision
  two machines try to talk at the same time
  systems listen while talking and if they sense collision, wait a period of time and retransmit
  
Hub
  layer 1 device
  repeater, many ports

switch
  replaces bridges and hubs
