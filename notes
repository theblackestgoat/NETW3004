OSI
1 physical - cabling, signal types, connectors, bits (0010101110000101010101010)
2 data-link - physical addressing, data delivery between 2 local nodes, framing data, mac addresses, ethernet
3 network - logical addressing and routing, ipv4 ipv6, icmp
4 transport - segmentation of data stream, provide for connections or connection-oriented data transfers, udp, tcp
5 session - establish, maintain, tear-down a logical communication channel between 2 remote application, sockes ip:port@---ip:port#
6 presentation - encoding and formatting of data, compression, encryption, jpg->bitstream->jpg
7 application - protocols that provide, network functionality to applications, http, ftp, dns, dhcp, smtp

tcp/ip
4 application - http, ftp, dns, dhcp, smtp, imap
3 transport - tcp, udp
2 network - ip, icmp
1 network interface - ethernet

module 1 - the basics

network 
  two or more devices connected together to allow them to share resources and communicate

Node
  any network device that can transmit, redistribute, or receive data

protocol
  set of rules that dictate how nodes communicate on a network

Network Scopes
  PAN - personal area network - smallest distance
  LAN - local area network - "in the building"
  CAN - campus area network - multiple buildings
  MAN - metropolitan area network - city
  WAN - wide area network - 
  WWAN - wireless wide area network
  GAN - global area network

route
  is the destination ip in my network or outside my network

Topology
How a network is laid out - physical and logical

Repeater
  layer 1 hardware device that amplidies and or regenerates an attenuated signal so it travels further down the media.
  commonly inserted inline of traffic

Bridge
  like a repeater but works at layer 2
  it learns and remembers MAC addresses attached on either side of it and uses that knowledge to make intelligent forwarding decisions
  breaks you network up into multiple smaller collision domains
  few poers
  makes software decisions

logical topoligies
  vlans
  subnets
  routing
  subinterfaces
  SSIDs

Bus
  physical - every system connected to the same line (thicknet/thinnet)
  logical - when on person is talking, everyone else can hear what's being said
  still used in most modern automobiles (CAN-BUS)

Ethernet protocol
  used in wired networks

Collision
  two machines try to talk at the same time
  systems listen while talking and if they sense collision, wait a period of time and retransmit
  
Hub
  layer 1 device
  repeater, many ports

switch
  layer 2 device
  replaces bridges and hubs
  still learns and remembers the mAC addresses attached to its interfaces and uses that knowledge to make intelligent forwarding decisions
  breaks you network up into smaller collision domains
  this is done at a hardware level
  increase the number of collision domains
  "invisible device"

ring topology
  systems connect from one to the next
  forward communication along the ring
  token packet, system holding token gets to tx
  token moves to next system after tx

Star Topology
  connecting device in the middle of several systems

Mesh Topology
  everything collected to everything
  partial mesh/hybrid topology - mix of mesh and start

network architecture

client/server
  user machines pulling resources of a centralized location

peer to peer
  no central repository of data
  torrents

Encalsulation / de-encapsulation
client data send

Lab 1 - Explore the TCP/IP model

Module 2 Network Transmission Media

Tranmission Media
  Pathway that physically carries data between nodes on a network

Bandwidth
  the media's theoretical capacity to carry a certain amount of network data per second

Throughput
  A network's actual measured amount of transferred network data per second

Multiplexing
  Technique that allows multiple data signals/streams to be combined over a shared media's bandwidth

Atenuation
  Signal degradation (loss) as it travels through the media

Noise
  signal degradation caused by the interaction with other energy sources
  emi electromagnetic intereference
  rfi radio freq

Signal to Noise Ratio SNR
  comparative strength of good signal to noise

module 5

logical network addressing

layer 3 addressing used for routing determinations
conifigured by homans
  statically
  dynamically
currently ipv4 is the most widely used version

ipv4
32 bit logical address
used dotted-decimal notation
4 decimal numbers separated by periods
  197.66.4.210
each decimal number represents 8 bits (octet)
logical addresses contain 2 components
  network id
  host id
ipv4 uses a subnet mask value to determine the netid and hsot id bits
